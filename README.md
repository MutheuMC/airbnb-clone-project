The goal of this project is to give you practical experience in developing a simple booking and management system using AirBnB as a case study. A good booking system should have a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

This is the final product you will be building:
Pages	Description	UI

Page-1	This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.	
Page-2	This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the AirBnB clone. It highlights key features such as the property‚Äôs name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasizes clarity and ease of use for potential renters.	
Page-3	This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the AirBnB clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalizing the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience.	
Property Listing View: A page displaying various property listings with essential details and images.
Listing Detailed View: A detailed view of a specific property, including more extensive information and images.
Simple Checkout View: A streamlined process for booking properties.
Search Functionality: A robust search feature enabling users to find properties based on criteria like location, price, and availability.
